## Summary
### From the 8 graphs that we performed, we can see that most of the bike rides are below one hour, male uses the bikes more than females and unknown users, and most users (especially subscribed users) ride between 6am to 9am, and 5pm to 7pm, which are peek hours for work commute. There are more additional visualizations are suggested for future analysis. For example, analysts should look at the relationship between the bike trips' locations (start and end) and the user types to see where most of the subscribed users use the bikes. Another example would be to look at the relation between the popular start and end location during peak hours.
